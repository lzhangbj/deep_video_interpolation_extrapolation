1. use vanilla CNN for single image discriminator, 
	use spatio-temperal CNN for vid discriminator

2. uncertainties exist in video prediction--->cVAE

3. In order to let the variational distribution qÏ†(z|x0, F) conditioned on the starting frame, 
	we stack x0 with each flow map fi in F as the encoder input

4. occlusion in optical flow --- predict a mask

5. seg2vid problems and solution:
	1. 2d optical flow can not solve 3d motion(as can be seen, longer frames tend to have severe distortion)
		solution: incorporate depth information
	2. occlusion mask and post-processing network can still not inpaint new pixels well
		solution: image inpainting networks

6. todo: use segmentation and depthmap based on seg2vid structure, produce a good 2d result
		only use gt depthmap for now to see the initial result
